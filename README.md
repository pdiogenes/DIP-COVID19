## How to use

Clone the repository and compile all files in the `src` folder with:  
`javac *.java utilities/*.java processing/*.java result/*.java object/*.java hist/*.java`  

Then run the file with:  
`java MainMenu`

Please keep in mind that you **NEED** to have the OpenCV library `.dll` file inside the folder `/app/opencv/x64/`.  You can find it [on their website](https://opencv.org/opencv-4-2-0/).

### Try it out!

Use the UI to open one of the provided images, then play around with it. You can zoom in and out, select an area of the image as a sample, check the image's grayscale histogram, and then apply one of the implemented digital image processing algorithms to find the viruses on the image.
